- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Thaisdahack

- ðŸ‘€ The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.
Ellen Parr

Crediting to Ellen Parr, quoted above, my piqued curiosity and insistence on never settling for the clichÃ© answer ''why so!!'' and always countering with the even more clichÃ© phrase "because yes is not the answer!!'' led me to face the enchanted and nebulous world of data from an early age.
Since my graduation in oceanography, I have followed this path and I have been challenging myself since then within the academic career, but the passion for entrepreneurship and the challenges inherent to it, made me yearn to improve my knowledge in a more applied way using programming languages â€‹â€‹such as Python, SQL , Tableau and using more refined techniques such as ETL, machine learning and advanced statistics.
My main focus is to be in constant learning and follow the most relevant tools in the market, which allow me to bring significant insights in a multidisciplinary and assertive way in solving business problems.
With commitment and especially empathy, I want to be relevant, and make decisions that lead to the success of my co-workers and especially to the growth of companies that are in line with my principles and professional goals.
